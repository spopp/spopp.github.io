## Project Documentation Pages

I will use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/spopp/spopp.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content of this website in Markdown files.

When I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild from the content in Markdown files.
